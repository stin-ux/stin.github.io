            <p>“Big Pharm” was a project that required me to go through the full web development cycle over a four-week timeframe. We had to adhere to strict technical requirements in addition to developing a visual identity and implementing functional code. This included a user-centric design approach, a responsive website that was between 320 and 1280 pixels wide, and a functional purchasing process.</p>

                <h1>Understanding The Client</h1>
                <p>I created the fictional company "Big Pharm," a Canadian insurance provider that offers tiers of healthcare coverage through subscriptions. This was because I wanted to explore how online services and brands use the design language of trust in order to appeal to a wide range of market-driven consumers.</p>
                <p>The primary objective of this company was to establish brand legitimacy, professionalism, and user-friendliness. Identifying these brand values helped me make decisions about the rest of the project and justified any modifications to the development process.</p>

                <h2>Research & Comparative Analysis</h2>
                <p>To achieve my speculative website prototype, I conducted a comparative analysis of regional health authorities and subscription-based service sites. This study shed light on how to predict user flows and use aesthetic appeal to promote website content while maintaining the company's core values.</p>
                <p>I laid a foundational wireframe in HTML before moving on to more intricate styling. The site skeleton, which prioritizes usability and accessibility, is represented by the first two iterations. Because of this, I was able to incorporate emotionally charged, market-driven branding into the final version without sacrificing the quality of the code.</p>

                <h1>Cohesive Brand Identity</h1>
                <p>The brand identity went through two major iterations after receiving feedback from my peers and prototyping the colors into the site content.</p>
                <p>This is an important step for the web design process, as this is where the client will make its first impression on both new and old customers. The visual language here is meant to communicate the client’s ideas of legitimacy, industry-level professionalism, and emotional appeal.</p>
                <p>Primary blues with easy text contrast against whites convey transparency and reflect cultural design cues of healthcare and personal service. Feedback colors, iconography, and the additional neutrals were chosen to be cohesive with site content and images.</p>

                <h1>Building Digital Trust: The Final Design</h1>
                <p>Responsivity was first implemented through efficient HTML and CSS usage, then supplemented by media queries to ensure 100% scalability across devices. The initial brand design was inconsistent, which became apparent during the development process as text on the screen began to clash with the content of the site, such as images. I eventually simplified the palette to both align with the site's content and to clearly communicate interactive elements such as links or buttons. Identifying the three most crucial goals allowed me to work efficiently within the tight deadline. These were user engagement, brand identity, and a smooth checkout process.</p>
                <h2>Key Learnings & Future Iterations</h2>
                <p>In retrospect, I would've initiated brand research and comparative analysis earlier to study optimal user pathways. Given more time, I would’ve gone more in-depth with understanding what makes these sites engaging, how they convey their values visually, and their efficiency at advertising their services through the site layout.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I would’ve taken more initiative over the design process by prioritizing earlier user testing and peer feedback to refine the design iteratively, rather than relying on receiving major feedback near the end of the project.</p>
